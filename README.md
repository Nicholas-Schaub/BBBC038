# Data Summary

These images form a diverse collection of biological images collectively containing tens of thousands of nuclei.The nuclei in the images are derived from a range of organisms including humans, mice, and flies. In addition, nuclei have been treated and imaged in a variety of conditions including fluorescent and histology stains, several magnifications, and varying quality of illumination. Finally, nuclei appear in different contexts and states including cultured mono-layers, tissues, and embryos, and cell division, genotoxic stress, and differentiation.
